    "## 1. A/B Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing is a form of two-sample (in this case) Z-Test, since it is normally used used to compare two versions of a product, website, ad, or feature to determine which one performs better (and therefore sample sizes are ussually large). It is widely used in marketing, UX design, and product optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "We essentially compare Group A (control group), which is the baseline, and Group B, which is the modified version. Usually there is a division of users between the 2 groups randomly to avoid bias and then proceed with the collection of data and the conduction of this test. Metrics collected to use in this test include, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conversion Rate (CR): Percentage of users completing a desired action.\n",
    "- Click-Through Rate (CTR): Percentage of users who clicked on a link.\n",
    "- Bounce Rate: Percentage of users who leave without engaging.\n",
    "- Revenue per User: How much revenue is generated per visitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis are essentially the same as in every two-sample test: either there isn't or is a significant difference between the 2 versions. Since it is a Z-test (because of the sample size and we are testing for the proportions (nature of the metrics presented)), Central Limit Theorem is applicable to the score formula, which results in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z = \\frac{p_B - p_A}{\\sqrt{SE_A^2 + SE_B^2}}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "A company wants to test two call-to-action (CTA) buttons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A (Control): \"Sign Up Now\"\n",
    "- B (Treatment): \"Get Started\"\n",
    "\n",
    "the test runs for a period of time, with the following results:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Group | Visitors | Conversions | Conversion Rate |\n",
    "|-------|----------|------------|----------------|\n",
    "| A     | 10,000  | 500        | 5%             |\n",
